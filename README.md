Run the following command to start the Angular development server:
npm install
ng serve

For the Spring Boot backend:
Navigate to the news_spring directory.
Run the following command to start the Spring Boot application:
mvn spring-boot:run
After running these commands, the frontend will be available at http://localhost:4200

3. Building for Deployment
If you want to build and deploy the application, follow these steps:
Build the Angular frontend:
Navigate to the news_angular directory.
Run the following command to build the Angular application:
ng build
This will generate a dist folder containing the build files.
Copy the build files to the Spring Boot project:
Copy the contents of the dist folder from the news_angular directory into the src/main/resources/static folder of the news_spring project.
Build the Spring Boot application:
Navigate to the news_spring directory.
Run the following command to package the application:
mvn clean package
This will create a .jar file in the target folder.

4. Run the packaged application
Once the .jar file is generated in the target folder, you can run it using the following command:
java -jar target/<your-jar-file-name>.jar
or just click it if you have installed java compiler on your device.
